# pedtricks package

It seems that pedantics is not maintained anymore. This package is taking the core functions from pedantics and removed the dependencies on archived packages ("MasterBayes") and removed function based on C libraries that are outdated.

New functions will include a ggplot function to plot pedigree `ggpedigree()` and more

Install with

```r
remotes::install_github(
  "JulienGAMartin/pedtricks"
)
```
